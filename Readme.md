# ðŸ”¥ Stress-Tested WebSocket Chat Server (AI HELPED MOSTLY)

A high-performance WebSocket-based chat server designed to test real-time communication at massive scale.

This project is not just a basic chat backend â€” itâ€™s a battle-tested, performance-logging, realistic-load-simulating chat system built for pushing servers to their limit. Whether you're learning system design or benchmarking a production-grade deployment, this project is engineered to give you deep insight into how your system behaves under load.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- âœ… Build a minimal but real-time chat application over WebSocket  
- âœ… Create realistic matchmaking and chat flows  
- âœ… Log all connection and messaging events persistently to disk  
- âœ… Track bandwidth, memory, and CPU usage over time  
- âœ… Simulate thousands of concurrent users  
- âœ… Provide human-readable performance reports and graphs  
- âœ… Test and analyze on both local machine and cloud servers (e.g., Render)

---

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket (`ws`)
- **Logging**: File-based persistent JSONL logs (`logs/chat-logs.jsonl`)
- **Monitoring**: `/report` page showing historical load stats
- **Client Load Testing**: Custom test script simulating hundredsâ€“thousands of clients

## ðŸ§ª Test Philosophy

Real-world chat isn't just 1 message per second. It's typing, idling, large payloads, bursts, and disconnects.

This test system is **evil ðŸ˜ˆ**:

- Simulates multi-minute chats  
- Sends long messages  
- Generates massive bandwidth and memory use  
- Tests scalability of connection handling, message relay, and matchmaking

## ðŸ“Š Performance Report

Accessible at: http://localhost:3000/report



Tracks:

- Total connections  
- Total matches  
- Messages relayed  
- Disconnects  
- Bandwidth (approximate)  
- Memory usage  
- CPU cores used  
- Uptime  

âœ… Logs are persisted across restarts  
âœ… Data is read entirely from disk logs  
âœ… No in-memory reset = true historical reporting
